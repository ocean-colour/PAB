# Design PAB

## Goals

We wish to generate a document `docs/design/PAB_design.md` that describes the design of PAB and its requirements.

We expect the package to do at least the following:

- Use argopy to fetch BGC-Argo data and then
  - Perform Q&A on those data with plots
  - Calclate and record the mixed layer depth (if not provided by argopy)
  - Measure bbp and Chl-a values in the mixed layer and record + tabulate
  - Record average salinity and temperature in the mixed layer
- Match-up the Argo profiles to PACE granules
- Extract the ~10 spectra from the PACE granules for BING analysis
- Run BING on the spectra
  - Calculate the IOPs and their uncertainties
  - Generate figures and tables
  - Tabulate
- Provide summary reports on the matchup analysis
  - Include figures, tables, and text
  - Use .rst files to be published on readthedocs.io

## Claude

### Skills

Consider using the skills in .claude/skills/

## Context

Examine the following files that may help generating the design:

- The code and files in the BING Repository: https://github.com/ocean-colour/BING.  In particular all of the files in the papers/biomass folder.
- The BING paper: docs/PDFs/bing.pdf
- The Bisson et al. papers in docs/PDFs/
- The argopy documentation: https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- Documentation on the PACE website for:
  - the granules (Level 2 products) and
  - how to process their data in the cloud
  - any APIs to extract individual spectra instead of full granules (might also need to be done in the Cloud)
- The context.md file in this repository: docs/context.md

## Overview

Guidelines for the design document which will be named IOPtics_design.md and will be stored in docs/design/.  Keep in mind:

- You are encouraged to suggest your own design ideas 
- This document will be used to guide the development of the IOPtics package
- It will not include specific code recommendations; we will generate a separate doc for that

## Prompts

### Context

1. Read the Context section above.  Read the code, files and websites mentioned.  Generate a docs/context.md file that you can refer to which is a reduced form of the information in the files.  Add a version number and date to the file.  Log your work in the Logs section below.

### Prep

1. Start the design document by including a preamble of what it is for.  Title that section "Preamble".

   - Add any other information you think is relevant
   - Add a version number to the document (0.1)
   - Add a date to the document (today's date)
   - Add a author to the document (JXP and Claude)


### Data

1. Read this doc.  Execute the 1st task in the Data section below
2. Read this doc.  Execute the 2nd task in the Data section below
3. Read this doc.  Execute the 3rd task in the Data section below

### Analysis

1. Read this doc.  Execute the 1st task in the Analysis section below
2. Read this doc.  Execute the 2nd task in the Analysis section below

## Data

We will be using two primary datasets in this Repository: BGC-Argo and PACE (Ocean Color Imager) data.  Do also provide hooks to include other in-situ datasets and satellite data in the future.

### PACE dataset

The PACE dataset is available from the Ocean Color Imager (OCI) on the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Earthdata Cloud.  See the context.md file for additional information.

### BGC-Argo dataset

The BGC-Argo dataset is available from the BGC-Argo project.  See the context.md file for additional information.

### Tasks

1. Let's begin writing the data section of the design document.  Write a section called "Data" and include the following:

- A table of the datasets to be used
- A description of each dataset
- A description of how to load the datasets
- A description of how to process the datasets
- A description of how to use the datasets
- A description of how to store the datasets
- A description of how to retrieve the datasets
- A description of how to analyze the datasets

You should examine the new code in the `ocpy` Repository (on this computer) and the code in the `argopy` Repository (on this computer) to help you write the data section (name it "Data").  Log your work in the Logs section below.  If you have any questions, write them in the Q&A section below.  

2. Please make several edits to the Data section of the design doc:

   - Modify the PACE data section to recognize:
     - While `ocpy` has methods for loading data from L2 granules on a hard drive, the primary intention is to load the data from the Earthdata Cloud.
     - Similarly, we will tend to avoid downloading full L2 granules except for debugging and development purposes.
   - We should rethink the CSV look-up tables.  While these are conveient for user inspection and easy I/O, they are not ideal for programmatic use.  We should consider using a database instead.  Make this a point of discussion
 
Now, I insist you ask questions to me before you continue.  And Log your work

3. Read my answers to the questions in the Q&A section below and make any necessary edits to the Data section of the design doc.  Log your work in the Logs section below.  If you have any additional questions, write them in the Q&A section below.  

### Q&A

Open questions for JXP, raised by Claude while drafting the Data section
(2026-06-18). Answers will be folded into `docs/design/PAB_design.md`.

**On PACE cloud access:**

1. **Compute environment.** Where will PAB's PACE processing primarily run —
   in-region AWS (`us-west-2`, e.g. a PACE Hackweek / 2i2c JupyterHub, which
   enables fast direct S3 streaming), local/out-of-region (HTTPS/OPeNDAP
   fallback), or should the design be agnostic and run in both?

   _A:_It will primarily run on my workstation in the AWS us-west-2 region.

2. **Spectrum extraction mechanism.** To read only the pixels we need without
   downloading whole granules, which approach do you prefer: (a) lazy `xarray`
   open over S3/HTTPS with nearest-pixel indexing (mirrors `ocpy`'s existing
   extraction, repointed at cloud URLs); (b) OPeNDAP server-side subsetting from
   OB.DAAC; (c) the Harmony subsetting service; or (d) document all three and
   decide later?

   _A:_Please provide more information on the first two options.  We will decide later.  I should add that you should also explore the `remote_sensing` package that I have built and which is on this computer.

3. **Earthdata authentication.** Is an Earthdata Login (`~/.netrc` /
   `earthaccess.login()`) already set up for this work, and is there a target
   compute account/region we should assume?

   _A:_Yes, I have set up the Earthdata Login on my workstation.

**On storage / lookup tables:**

4. **CSV vs. database direction.** Do you want the design to recommend a
   specific backend now — SQLite (embedded, single file), DuckDB+Parquet
   (embedded, analytical), or PostgreSQL (client/server, multi-user) — or keep
   it as an open discussion until the scale/sharing model is settled?

   _A:_ Let's choose SQLite as the preferred backend for now.

5. **Scale and sharing.** What scale should we design for (rough order of
   matchups/profiles), and is the matchup store intended to be single-user/
   collaborator-shared files, or a shared/community archive with concurrent
   updates? This is the main driver of the backend choice.

   _A:_The database may grow to 10,000 Argo profiles and 10x as many PACE spectra analyzed.

6. **Relationship to BING outputs.** Should the BING fit outputs (chains,
   posterior summaries, derived IOPs) live in the same store as the matchup
   tables, or remain separate NPZ/JSON keyed by a matchup ID?

   _A:_The extracted values should be stored in the database.  The fit outputs (chains, figures) should be stored in separate files.

**On scope:**

7. **Reference datasets in the data layer.** Should L23 / GLORIA / PANGAEA be
   first-class citizens of the same loader/storage machinery now, or kept to the
   later Analysis/Validation sections so the data layer focuses on the
   PACE↔BGC-Argo matchup?

   _A:_Sorry, ignore the L23, GLORIA and PANGAEA datasets for now. That was a mistake.

## Analysis

Analysis will primarily proceed following the approach currently in the bing/papers/biomass/Analysis folder.  The primary differences are:

1. We wish to semi-automate the process.  
2. We wish to enhance and better record the provenance of the effort, ie. the input parameters and the output results.  We may want a versioning schema
3. We may wish to expose the fit outputs for the community to inspect.  At the very least we want the BING figures to be viewable.  Each is ~1Mb.  Will this be a problem on GitHub?

### Tasks

1. Please examine the context files and especially the code in the bing/papers/biomass/Analysis folder.  Generate a plan for the analysis methods.  Write the plan in the Analysis section of the design document.  If you have any questions, write them in the Q&A section below. Log your work.

2. I have answered the questions in the Q&A section below.  I have the following additional items to include:

    - We may choose to process PACE Level 1B data with our own algorithms to estiamte Rrs and its uncertainties.  The code will need to allow for this.
    - The design doc should note that we will not use any of the code in the bing/papers/biomass/Analysis folder.  We will take what we need from those modules and generate entirely new ones in the PAB package.

Please make any necessary edits to the Analysis section of the design document.  Log your work in the Logs section below.  If you have any additional questions, write them in the Q&A section below.  

### Q&A

Open questions for JXP, raised by Claude while drafting the Analysis section
(2026-06-18). Answers will be folded into `docs/design/PAB_design.md`.

1. **Default model pair.** Is `ExpBricaud` + `Pow` (the biomass workhorse) the
   right default for PAB, and do you want the GIOP and/or GSM baselines run
   automatically alongside it for every matchup, or only on request?

   _A: Yes, the ExpBricaud + Pow model is the right default for PAB.  We will only run that model for now, but the code base should be prepared for additional ones.  We will need a naming schema for their outputs, e.g. BING_ExpBPow_bbp, ...

2. **Automated model selection.** Should PAB *automatically* choose the model
   complexity per spectrum via AIC/BIC (fitting a ladder of models and picking
   the favored one), or always fit a single fixed model pair and just *report*
   the IC values?

   _A: N/A for now

3. **Versioning scheme.** For the provenance/versioning requirement, which do
   you prefer to stamp on each fit: (a) a semantic `pab_version` string, (b) a
   hash of the full pipeline configuration (models+priors+MCMC+RT options), or
   (c) a monotonic run/batch ID — or some combination?

   _A: I like a `pab_version` string.

4. **MCMC settings.** Keep the biomass defaults (`nsteps≈10000`, `nburn≈1000`,
   16 walkers) as PAB's standard, or expose them per-run and record per fit?
   (They are recorded as provenance regardless.)

   _A: Keep the biomass defaults.

5. **Figure storage / exposure.** Given ~1 MB/figure and ~10⁵ spectra, do you
   agree with: don't commit per-fit figures to git, store/regenerate them
   externally, and publish only a curated subset + population figures via
   readthedocs? If you want versioned figure storage, should we plan on Git LFS,
   release assets, or an S3 bucket in your us-west-2 account?

   _A: Well, we would likely only expose one fit per matchup, so the figure size is not a major problem for now.  And we should find a way to reduce the figure size from 1MB to 100KB

6. **What to expose to the community.** Beyond viewable BING figures, should the
   exposed products include the extracted-value tables (CSV/SQLite export), the
   raw MCMC chains (NPZ), and/or an interactive way to query matchups — and is
   readthedocs the only intended channel, or also a data release (e.g. Zenodo)?

   _A: Good questions.  Ask again when we work on the Reporting section below.

## Reporting

A big part of PBA will be to provide the community quick-look views of the matchup results.  These should be accessible via a web interface.  

If you think there are additional items the community would like to see and/or access, please add them to the Reporting section of the design document.

## Logs


### 2026-06-17 (Context #1: generated docs/context.md)

Per Context prompt #1, read the sources in the *Context* section and produced
`docs/context.md` (v1.0, 2026-06-17, authors JXP and Claude) — a distilled,
single-page reference for writing the design doc. Coverage:

- **BING** (`docs/PDFs/bing.pdf`, Prochaska & Frouin 2025): the IOP retrieval
  engine. Captured the Gordon forward model (G1=0.0949, G2=0.0794), the central
  `bb/a` physical degeneracy, the `k`=2–5 IOP model ladder (the `expb_pow`
  workhorse, GIOP/GSM as constrained variants), `emcee` MCMC + LM fitting,
  AIC/BIC model selection, posterior-percentile uncertainties, and the key
  finding that multispectral sensors recover ≤3 params while PACE/OCI can reach
  ~4–5 (bbp the most robust observable). Also summarized the BING repo layout
  and flagged `papers/biomass/` as the closest existing PACE↔BGC-Argo matchup
  template (`fitting.py::closest_Rrs`, Stoer-2024 carbon pipeline).
- **Bisson 2019/2021** (`docs/PDFs/`): the matchup methodology — MLD via the
  0.03 kg m⁻³ density threshold, 3-point moving-median de-spiking, averaging
  float bbp within the MLD, 5×5 unflagged pixel box, tight time window — and
  the warning that satellite Rrs carries a season/region-dependent bias
  (strongest in oligotrophic gyres).
- **argopy** (docs + local `../argopy`): `DataFetcher` with `ds='bgc'`,
  `src='erddap'`, `.region(...)`; `params`/`measured` kwargs; CHLA/BBP700/PSAL/
  TEMP/PRES; no public MLD accessor (use `teos10`→`SIG0` + `gsw`, or
  `reduce_profile`); `ArgoIndex` for index-first matchup pre-selection.
- **PACE/OCI**: product `PACE_OCI_L2_AOP` (v3.1, OB.DAAC), NetCDF groups
  (`geophysical_data`→Rrs/Rrs_unc/l2_flags, `navigation_data`,
  `sensor_band_parameters`→`wavelength_3d`≈172), earthaccess access pattern,
  cloud (us-west-2 S3) vs HTTPS, nearest-unflagged-pixel spectrum extraction,
  and the standard `l2_flags` ocean mask.
- A candidate-datasets table (L23, PANGAEA, GLORIA/G13, BGC-Argo, SeaBASS/NOMAD,
  MOBY, CALIOP) and a source index.

What I learned: BING's degeneracy result directly shapes PAB's validation
expectations — bbp (amplitude + slope) is the robust matchup observable, while
phytoplankton absorption is only marginally retrievable even with PACE; and the
Bisson papers already define the float-side processing recipe PAB should adopt.

Side note: the web-research sub-agents added WebFetch allow-rules to
`.claude/settings.json` (github/raw.githubusercontent/api.github) and created
`.claude/settings.local.json` (pace/nasa domains). These are benign permission
allowlists; left in place — revert if undesired.

### 2026-06-17 (Prep #1 redo: recreated the design document with a Preamble)

The design document was missing from `docs/design/` (the file logged earlier
under Prep #1/#2 was not present on disk — most likely lost since it was never
committed). Per Prep prompt #1, recreated it directly as
`docs/design/IOPtics_design.md` (v0.1, 2026-06-17, authors JXP and Claude) with
a titled **Preamble** section covering: the document's purpose (guiding,
code-free, living design reference for IOPtics/PAB), the package scope and goals
(argopy BGC-Argo fetch/Q&A/MLD/mixed-layer bbp+Chl-a+T+S, PACE matchup, ~10-Rrs
extraction, BING IOP retrieval + uncertainties, .rst reports for readthedocs,
plus hooks for future datasets/satellites), its relationship to `docs/context.md`
and the BING/ocpy/argopy packages, and basic conventions. Included the requested
version (0.1), date, and authors.

### 2026-06-17 (Data #1: wrote the Data section of the design document)

Per the Data task #1, added a **Data** section to the design doc. First resolved
a naming conflict — the Goals now name the doc `docs/design/PAB_design.md` while
the Overview still says `IOPtics_design.md`; per the user's choice the doc is
now `docs/design/PAB_design.md`.

Examined the relevant local code to ground the section: in **ocpy** —
`pace/io.py` (`load_oci_l2`, `load_oci_l2_spectrum` (nearest-pixel, reads a
single spectrum off disk), `load_oci_l2_spectrum_pixel`, `load_iop_l2` exposing
NASA's `a`/`bb`/`aph`/`bbp_442`/`adg_*`), `satellites/pace.py`
(`wave`, `gen_noise_vector` from `PACE_error.csv`),
`hydrolight/loisel23.py` (`load_ds(X,Y,profile)`, `calc_Chl`),
`insitu/gloria.py` (`load_gloria`), `insitu/panagea.py` (`load`, `spectrum`,
`to_long`); and in **argopy** the `DataFetcher(ds='bgc', src='erddap')` /
`ArgoIndex(index_file='bgc-s')` access patterns plus the `argo` accessor
(`point2profile`, `filter_qc`, `teos10`→`SIG0` for MLD).

The Data section covers: a datasets-at-a-glance table (BGC-Argo + PACE AOP as
primary; PACE IOP, L23, GLORIA, PANGAEA as secondary/reference; future hooks);
per-dataset descriptions; loading (the existing ocpy/argopy entry points);
processing (Argo MLD via the 0.03 kg m⁻³ density threshold, 3-pt de-spike,
mixed-layer averaging; PACE scaling, `l2_flags` ocean mask, nearest-unflagged
pixel, noise vector); matchup/use/analysis (5×5 box + tight time window → ~10
Rrs → BING → compare bbp vs float + NASA L2 IOP); storage/retrieval (raw cache
via earthaccess + argopy cache and the BGC index for index-first pre-selection,
intermediate matchup tables as CSV/Parquet à la `papers/biomass`, NPZ/JSON fit
outputs); and extensibility hooks (common matchup-record schema, loader
registry, satellite abstraction). No open questions for the Q&A section.

What I learned: ocpy already provides the exact PACE single-spectrum extraction
PAB needs (`load_oci_l2_spectrum` does nearest-pixel-by-distance and reads only
that spectrum), and a NASA L2 IOP loader for a ready baseline comparison — so
the data layer is largely an orchestration/caching effort over existing loaders
rather than new I/O.

### 2026-06-18 (Data #2: edited the Data section; raised Q&A in the design doc)

Per Data task #2, made two edits to the Data section of `docs/design/PAB_design.md`:

- **PACE cloud-first.** Reworked the PACE-AOP loading bullet and the
  Storage/retrieval subsection to state that the *primary* intention is to read
  PACE data directly from the NASA Earthdata Cloud (via `earthaccess`), with the
  `ocpy` hard-drive granule readers (`load_oci_l2`, `load_oci_l2_spectrum`,
  `load_oci_l2_spectrum_pixel`) used mainly for **debugging/development**, and
  that PAB **avoids downloading full L2 granules** except for dev/offline work
  (reads only the needed pixels).
- **CSV → database.** Reframed the "intermediate matchup tables" bullet to note
  CSV's limits for programmatic use, and added a **"Discussion: lookup tables —
  CSV vs. a database"** subsection laying out the trade-offs and candidate
  backends (SQLite / DuckDB+Parquet / PostgreSQL), with a default of defining a
  schema now behind a thin storage interface so CSV can migrate to a DB later.

Then — per the explicit instruction to ask questions before continuing — I added
a **Q&A** subsection to the design doc (the user redirected my interactive
questions into the doc) with 7 open questions for JXP: PACE compute environment
(in-region vs local), cloud spectrum-extraction mechanism (lazy xarray/S3 vs
OPeNDAP vs Harmony), Earthdata auth, CSV-vs-DB backend direction, scale/sharing
model, whether BING fit outputs share the matchup store, and whether the
reference datasets (L23/GLORIA/PANGAEA) belong in the data layer now. Awaiting
answers before finalizing these parts of the design.

Note: the earlier (Data #1) log line "No open questions for the Q&A section" is
now superseded — the Q&A above lists open questions.

### 2026-06-18 (Data #3: folded JXP's Q&A answers into the Data section)

Per Data task #3, read JXP's answers in the Q&A and revised the Data section of
`docs/design/PAB_design.md` accordingly. Also explored the **remote_sensing**
package on this workstation (per JXP's note in Q2). Key changes:

- **Cloud-first + in-region (Q1, Q3).** Stated that PAB runs on a workstation in
  AWS `us-west-2` with Earthdata Login configured, so in-region direct cloud
  access is the design target.
- **New "Cloud access (PACE)" subsection (Q2).** Detailed the two extraction
  mechanisms with pros/cons, decision deferred: (a) lazy `xarray` open over S3
  (nearest-pixel read transfers one spectrum; reuses `ocpy`/`remote_sensing`
  readers with only the file handle becoming a remote object) and (b) OPeNDAP
  server-side subsetting (minimal transfer, works out-of-region, per-request
  latency). Grounded in the actual `remote_sensing` code I found:
  `process.swot_ssh_utils` already implements the in-region `s3fs` +
  `xr.open_dataset(s3sys.open(...))` pattern (notes us-west-2 requirement);
  `download.earthaccess` wraps CMR search + a granule→DataFrame table
  (`query_modis_oc`, `build_granule_table` with footprint polygons/time/CC/URL);
  `download.podaac` already distinguishes the `OPENDAP DATA` URL subtype;
  `netcdf/oc.py` has sensor-agnostic OC L2 helpers (`create_quality_mask`,
  `quality_control`, `extract_rrs_spectrum`, `find_rrs_variables`). Recommended
  starting with (a) while keeping discovery/pixel-selection factored so (b) can
  slot in.
- **SQLite chosen (Q4, Q5).** Replaced the open CSV-vs-DB discussion with a
  decision: extracted/tabular values (mixed-layer summaries, matchup index,
  scalar IOP results) go in a single-file **SQLite** DB; CSV/Parquet kept as
  exports only. Noted the scale (~10⁴ Argo profiles, ~10⁵ PACE spectra) sits
  well within SQLite's single-user range; DuckDB+Parquet and PostgreSQL recorded
  as deferred alternatives behind a thin storage interface.
- **Fit outputs split (Q6).** Bulky BING outputs (MCMC chains, figures) stored
  as separate files (NPZ/JSON, PNG/PDF) keyed by matchup/fit ID, not in the DB.
- **Dropped reference datasets (Q7).** Removed L23 / GLORIA / PANGAEA from the
  datasets table, descriptions, loading, and processing; the data layer now
  focuses on the PACE↔BGC-Argo matchup (PACE L2 IOP retained as the NASA
  baseline). Generalized the extensibility hooks accordingly and added
  `remote_sensing` to the reused-packages list (Preamble + intro).

No additional open questions. What I learned: `remote_sensing` already supplies
both halves of the cloud path PAB needs — Earthdata/CMR granule discovery with a
footprint table for spatial matchup, and a proven in-region S3 lazy-open pattern
— so PAB's PACE access can be assembled largely from existing code.

### 2026-06-18 (Analysis #1: wrote the Analysis section of the design document)

Per Analysis task #1, examined the local **BING** package
(`/home/xavier/Oceanography/python/bing`) and its `papers/biomass/Analysis`
folder, then wrote an **Analysis** section into `docs/design/PAB_design.md`.

Examined: `bing/papers/biomass/Analysis/py/end_to_end_workflow.py` (the staged
slurp→match→find-closest→fit→slurp pipeline), `fitting.py`
(`fit_em_all`/`fit_one`/`fit_me`, two-stage LM→MCMC with `ExpBricaud`+`Pow`),
`bing/scripts/fit_Rrs.py` (the public fit recipe), and the core API:
`models/utils.init`, `models/anw.py` + `bbnw.py` (model libraries),
`fitting/inference.py` (`init_mcmc`, `fit_one`, `fit_batch`, `run_emcee`),
`fitting/chisq_fit.py` (LM), `evaluate.py` (`calc_stats`,
`reconstruct_from_chains`, `thin_burn_chains`), `stats.py` (`calc_chisq`,
`calc_ICs` → AIC/BIC), `rt/rrs.py` (Gordon forward model), `plotting.py`.

The Analysis section covers: the biomass reference workflow; the per-spectrum
BING fit (init models → priors → LM warm-start → MCMC → reconstruct/summarize),
defaulting to `ExpBricaud`+`Pow` with `bbp` as the key observable; model
selection & diagnostics (χ², AIC/BIC, convergence QC); comparison of BING vs
NASA-L2-IOP vs in-situ Argo `bbp` and the metrics that follow; per-fit and
population figures + tables (extracted scalars → SQLite, exportable to
CSV/.rst); semi-automation (idempotent, resumable stage runner); and provenance
& versioning (record inputs, config, and package/git versions; proposed stamping
a version/config-hash per fit).

Addressed JXP's embedded question (Analysis intro #3) on ~1 MB BING figures on
GitHub: a single 1 MB file is fine, but ~10⁵ figures (~100 GB) must NOT be
committed — recommended generating on demand / external object store +
publishing a curated subset and population figures via readthedocs, with Git
LFS / release assets / S3 as options if versioned figure storage is wanted.

Per JXP's standing preference (now saved to memory), I did NOT use interactive
prompts; I recorded 6 open questions in the **Analysis → Q&A** section of
`design_prompts.md` (default model pair + GIOP/GSM baselines; automated AIC/BIC
model selection vs fixed model; versioning scheme; MCMC defaults; figure
storage/exposure; what else to expose to the community + channel) and await
JXP's answers before finalizing those parts.

### 2026-06-18 (Analysis #2: folded answers + new items into the Analysis section)

Per Analysis task #2, read JXP's Q&A answers and the two additional items, then
revised the Analysis section of `docs/design/PAB_design.md`:

From the answers:
- **Single default model.** PAB runs only `ExpBricaud`+`Pow` for now, but the
  code must be prepared for more pairs. Added an **output naming schema** —
  results namespaced as `BING_ExpBPow_bbp`, `…_beta`, `…_aph`, `…_unc`, with the
  NASA baseline as `NASA_L2IOP_bbp` — so additional pairs write parallel columns
  without collision.
- **No automated model selection** (N/A for now): renamed "Model selection &
  diagnostics" → "Diagnostics"; χ² and AIC/BIC are *reported* per fit, not used
  to select a model; ladder/ΔBIC selection noted as a future capability only.
- **Versioning = `pab_version` string** (decided): removed the config-hash/run-ID
  hedge; every fit stamped with `pab_version` + timestamp, new version instead of
  overwrite.
- **MCMC defaults kept** (`nsteps≈10000`, `nburn≈1000`, 16 walkers) as PAB's
  standard, recorded as provenance.
- **Figures**: one figure per matchup (~10⁴, not the ~10⁵ spectra), with an
  explicit **~100 KB target** (down from ~1 MB; via lower DPI / rasterization /
  PNG optimization). Revised the GitHub discussion accordingly (the full set is
  ~1 GB, "not a major concern for now"; still prefer readthedocs/external store
  over git history).
- **Community products** deferred to the **Reporting** section per JXP.

From the two new items:
- **PACE L1B option.** Added an "Rrs source" subsection: PAB must allow deriving
  `Rrs`/σ_Rrs from PACE **Level-1B** with our own algorithms; the Rrs source is a
  pluggable upstream stage (L2_AOP vs PAB_L1B:<algo/version>) feeding the same
  fit pipeline, with the source recorded as provenance.
- **No biomass code reuse.** Added a prominent **Code-reuse principle**: PAB will
  NOT use any code in `bing/papers/biomass/Analysis` — those scripts are a
  scientific *reference* only; PAB reimplements all orchestration anew while
  still depending on the installable **BING package** API (plus ocpy/argopy/
  remote_sensing). Reframed every biomass-script reference (`fit_em_all`,
